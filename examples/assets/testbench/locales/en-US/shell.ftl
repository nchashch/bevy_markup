tb-desc-big-document = One document of N rows; churn changes about one row in a hundred per frame, so unchanged rows reuse the previous build.
tb-desc-all-dirty = Every row changes every frame: the full render, parse, cascade and diff.
tb-desc-restyle-storm = A context var() recolours every row and a highlight moves each frame: restyles in place.
tb-desc-markdown = A Markdown template with indented Tera blocks, re-rendered every frame.
tb-desc-localized = N rows of Fluent messages in a Markdown bundle, cached and per-value paths, arguments changing per frame.
tb-desc-many-uis = N separate small UIs; churn updates one of them per frame.
tb-desc-calc-layout = N cards sized by mixed-unit calc(), resolved per frame against the stage.
tb-desc-nested-rules = A stylesheet of 20 000 nested rules: its load must fail cleanly instead of aborting the app.
tb-desc-deep-dom = 5 000 nested elements: content past 100 levels is dropped and the rest builds.
tb-desc-var-bombs = var() chains, doubling fallbacks, cycles and nested functions: the substitution stays bounded.
tb-desc-grid-bombs = Grid track counts that used to overflow: the declarations drop, nothing panics.
tb-desc-hostile-args = Fluent string arguments carrying HTML, Markdown links and images and crafted markers: shown as text, nothing forged.
tb-desc-args-injection = Arguments built two ways from a hostile name: the Tera map literal keeps it whole, the hand-written JSON splice is injectable.
tb-desc-remote-sources = An https:// include and border-image: the include fails its load and the image is skipped.
tb-desc-markdown-bombs = Pathological Markdown: deep emphasis, brackets and quotes, crafted class markers, nested indented Tera blocks.
tb-desc-reuse-vs-fresh = A UI mutated at random every frame is compared with a fresh build of the same state every few frames.
tb-desc-indent-vs-flat = An indented and a flat Markdown template of the same document must build the same UI.
tb-desc-selector-list = N rows in a container, plus a list and a table, styled by structural pseudo-classes, sibling combinators, attribute selectors and :not(); about one row in a hundred changes per frame, and the unchanged rows must keep reusing.
tb-desc-text-features = text-align, line-height, letter-spacing, text-transform and white-space on N rows in an overflow: auto panel with a tiled background image, plus list markers and a table.
tb-desc-selector-bombs = Extreme An+B offsets, a 10 000-character attribute value, 1 000 sibling rules, 200 nested :not() and combinator characters inside quoted values: nothing panics and the quoted probes still match.
tb-desc-sibling-bombs = One container of N siblings under ~, :nth-child and :last-of-type rules while the .hot element moves every frame.
tb-desc-entity-bombs = 50 000 character references without a semicolon, a 100 000-letter name and references in attributes: decoding stays linear and correct.
tb-desc-selectors-vs-fresh = The selector list mutated at random every frame (change, insert, remove, move, highlight), compared with a fresh build of the same state every few frames.
tb-desc-restyle-vs-full = The focus moves to a random row every frame (:focus, :focus-visible, :focus-within, :not(), + and ~); every few frames the scoped result is compared with a forced full restyle of the same UI.
tb-desc-order-independence = Rows whose style depends only on themselves (data-* attributes, classes): a fresh build of the same rows in reverse order must style every row the same. Catches results cached on too little, which a same-order twin shares.
tb-desc-idle-quiet = calc() widths, an overflow: auto panel, a background image, transitions and structural selectors with identical contexts written every frame: after settling, no build, no restyle and no Node write.
tb-desc-scaling = A container of N siblings with unterminated references next to one of 4N; phases alternate which one churns, and the 4N frame may cost at most 8 times the N frame (best of three).
