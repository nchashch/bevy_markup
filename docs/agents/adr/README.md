# Architecture Decision Records

Short, dated writeups of significant decisions in bevy_markup: the
alternatives considered, why one was picked, and what it cost. They are
separate from [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md), which describes the code's
*current* state and is rewritten as it changes. An ADR stays as written; a
later one supersedes it. Format and rules:
[`docs/agents/skills/adr.md`](../skills/adr.md).

0001–0012 were written retrospectively on 2026-10-06 from the git history
(`59f8f32..d2c9b63`), the `AGENTS.md` text at each commit, the bug ledger,
and the omp session that designed 0007–0012 together with the project owner.
Each record says who made the decision and marks reasoning nobody recorded
as `[INFERENCE]`.
