| Scope | ADR 0031's windowed build: `59f8f32`..`bd99546` (`HtmlWindowed`, `WindowModel`, `measure_window_heights`, the cull in `collect_node`/`collect_items`, `coalesce_spacers`, the count-mismatch replacement in `update_children`, the testbench's `--windowed`/`--scroll`), and the open bug_0151 |
| Method | the diff read against the ADR; layout-harness probes (temporary tests, since removed) and reproduction tests comparing a windowed UI with an unwindowed build of the same document at the same scroll offset; the testbench run offscreen through the MCP harness at `bd99546` and with the fix, screenshots compared |
| Focus | bug_0151's root cause; correctness, performance and the ADR's claims |
| Findings | `J01`… (stable ids) |
| Discovery agent | Claude Code session, `claude-opus-5-5` |

J01 (bug_0151) is fixed in this session; J02, J03, J08 and J09 in the
first follow-up, J04 and J05 in the second (see **Fixes**). Every finding has a reproduction test that
fails at `bd99546` (`review_0006::*` in `tests/html_ui.rs`).

## Summary

bug_0151 has a simple cause. Coalescing a run of k culled siblings into
one spacer drops the k − 1 row gaps between them. The cursor that
decides the band counts those gaps; the laid-out spacer doesn't. So
every materialized row sits (k − 1) × gap above where the band was
computed for. With the testbench's 2 px root gap, 5 500 culled rows put
the band 11 000 px above the viewport, the figure the bug report caught.
The fix makes a spacer remember its column's gap and adds one gap per
merge. The earlier attempts fixed other things (pixel units,
re-measurement) and couldn't touch it. The probes checked the model's
total against the laid-out content, and both lacked the same gaps
(200 000 + 66 × 2 = 200 132). The vector had no gap and checked which
rows exist, never where they sit.

The rest of the review: windowing works only for a flat top-level
document. Content inside any container (`<main>`, a `<section>`)
materializes in full, because only the root's direct children are ever
measured. A root with padding or a border (and any HiDPI display)
clears the model and rebuilds every frame. And scrolling never reuses
the band: each scroll frame re-collects every materialized row from
scratch, and every sub-pixel step rebuilds.

## Findings

**J01 · high · The band drifts above the viewport while scrolling (bug_0151)** — `ec085b1` [probe] — **fixed**
- `coalesce_spacers` summed the merged members' heights. A column puts
  one gap after a node, so k culled siblings lose k − 1 gaps once merged.
  The cursor (`collect_items`' root loop, `collect_node`'s `ys`) adds
  `outer + gap` per row. The materialized rows land
  `(culled above − 1) × gap` higher than the band was computed for.
- A second, smaller error in the same cursor: the root loop advanced by
  `win.frames.borrow().last()`'s gap. That is the root's only until the
  first materialized container pushes its own frame; after that it was
  the row's `gap: 8px`, not the root's 2 px. The band's lower edge then
  falls short; a one-viewport margin hides it.
- **Probe:** a windowed UI and an unwindowed one, 300 one-line
  paragraphs, `gap: 4px`, both scrolled to 2 400 px: all 26 materialized
  rows sit 360 px above their place (90 gaps × 4 px). The testbench at
  `bd99546` (`big-document --size 10000 --no-churn --windowed --scroll`,
  offscreen) shows an empty stage mid-sweep, the owner's symptom. The
  scripted sweep does reproduce it.
- **Fix:** `Item::Spacer { height, gap }` (the culling frame's gap),
  `coalesce_spacers` adds one gap per merge, and the root loop reads the
  root frame's gap. The fixed sweep renders rows throughout, and the
  content extent becomes 219 998 px (10 000 rows + 9 999 gaps; it read
  200 132 at `bd99546`).
- **Tests:**
  - `windowed_rows_sit_where_the_full_build_puts_them`,
    `windowed_bench_rows_track_the_scroll_at_every_depth` and
    `a_hover_restyle_keeps_the_band`: every materialized row sits within
    1 px of the unwindowed build, and every row in the viewport is
    materialized. Each fails without the coalescing fix.
  - `a_marginless_band_still_covers_the_viewport` fails without the
    root-gap fix.
- The second symptom (hovering changes the visible count) wasn't
  reproduced separately; the hover test passes with the fix.

**J02 · high (perf) · Nothing inside a container is ever culled** [probe]
- `measure_window_heights` looks the model up on the measured entity's
  *parent* (`models.get_mut(parent)`, a query `With<HtmlUi>`). Only the
  root's direct children find it. For every deeper keyed entity it
  inserts a `WindowModel` on the parent container instead
  (`commands.entity(parent).insert(WindowModel::default())`), and the
  height is never recorded.
- So a container's children have no heights, its cursor frame
  invalidates at the first child, and nothing inside it culls. The ADR's
  nested cursor frames (`frame_for`, the `ys` walk) never cull anything.
  Most real pages wrap their content (`<main>`, a `<section>`, a
  `<div class="list">`). For them windowing is a no-op that still pays
  the measuring and the stray components.
- **Probe:** 600 rows inside `<main>`: 1 801 of 1 801 elements
  materialized. The same rows at the top level: 72. One band at the top
  level leaves 25 row containers carrying a `WindowModel`; inside
  `<main>`, 602.
- **Tests:** `content_inside_a_container_is_windowed`,
  `only_the_windowed_root_carries_a_window_model`.
- **Fix direction:** walk up to the windowed root (the nearest
  `HtmlUi` ancestor) for the model. Bail out when it isn't windowed;
  never insert on an arbitrary parent.

**J03 · high (perf) · A root with padding or a border, or a HiDPI display, rebuilds every frame and culls nothing** [probe]/[code]
- The width anchor mixes units. The build compares
  `computed.size.x` (the root's **border box**, **physical** pixels)
  with `model.width` (`content_width`: border and padding subtracted,
  times `inverse_scale_factor`, so a **logical content** width). They
  agree only for a root with no padding and no border at scale factor 1.
  Otherwise `window_changed` is true every frame (a rebuild every frame)
  and `model.clear()` runs every build (nothing culls).
- The same mix elsewhere: the band's `viewport = node.size.y` is
  physical while the scroll offset is logical. The measurement also
  multiplies the logical margins by `inverse_scale_factor`
  (`(margin_top + size.y + margin_bottom) * inverse_scale_factor`). So
  `77086c8`'s HiDPI fix is incomplete, and the CHANGELOG's "Fixed" entry
  overstates it.
- **Probe:** `html { padding: 8px }` on a windowed root: 30 builds in 30
  idle frames, and the dump fully materialized.
- **Test:** `a_padded_windowed_root_settles_and_culls`. HiDPI isn't
  testable in the harness (scale 1); [code].
- **Fix direction:** one unit system (logical) and one box (content)
  for the anchor, the viewport and the heights; compare like with like.

**J04 · medium (perf) · Scrolling never reuses the band** [probe]
- A scroll-only build is a `Decision::Build` with an unchanged document.
  `skeleton_eligible` requires `rendered.is_changed() || restyle`, so it
  never pairs: every scroll frame re-cascades and re-collects every
  materialized row, and `update_children` diffs them all. ADR 0031 §1
  ("reuse-before-cull") and the CHANGELOG's "scrolling rebuilds at band
  cost" describe this cost, but the rows that stay in the band don't
  have to pay it: the skeleton holds their specs.
- **Probe:** a one-row scroll: `last_reuse() = (0, 74)`. The testbench's
  `reuse` check fails under `--windowed` (0 of 248).
- **Test:** `scrolling_by_one_row_reuses_the_band`.

**J05 · low (perf) · Every sub-pixel scroll rebuilds** [probe]
- `window_changed` compares the scroll offset exactly
  (`scroll.y != rebuild.window_scroll`). A smooth or trackpad scroll
  rebuilds every frame even when the band's membership doesn't change.
  The band has a viewport of margin on each side, so a rebuild is
  needed only when the offset crosses a row boundary at the band's
  edges.
- **Probe:** a 0.5 px scroll: one rebuild, the same band.
- **Test:** `a_scroll_inside_the_band_does_not_rebuild`.

**J06 · medium · The tests checked existence, never position** [code]
- `windowed_build_materializes_the_band_and_spacers_the_rest`:
  - Its root has no `gap`, the one setting that exposes J01.
  - It checks which paragraphs exist, never where they are laid out.
  - Its "height invariant" (`assert_eq!(100.0 + 500.0 + 30.0 * 20.0,
    60.0 * 20.0)`) compares constants with each other.
- `mouse_wheel_scrolls_a_windowed_ui` asserts only that a spacer exists.
- The CULLPROBE diagnostic compared the model's total with the laid-out
  content. Both lacked the same gaps, so it read "consistent".
- **The method:** compare a windowed UI with an unwindowed build of the
  same document at the same scroll offset, by position (the J01 tests'
  `band_errors`). An incremental path checked against itself shares its
  bugs.

**J07 · low · ADR 0031 and the docs describe behavior the code doesn't have** [code]
- §3 "focus navigation to an off-window element materializes it first":
  nothing in `focus.rs` reads the window (the `HtmlWindowed` doc says
  focus stays inside the window, so the doc is right and the ADR wrong).
- §5 "off … in headless test harnesses": not implemented (harmless; the
  tests rely on it being on).
- The ADR's measured win (17.2 vs 77.9 ms) holds for a flat top-level
  document only (J02).
- AGENTS.md says only *newly added* keys are measured; `5f8e673` also
  re-measures on `Changed<ComputedNode>`.

**J08 · medium (perf) · A windowed UI stays fully built until it is scrolled** [probe] — found fixing J03
- The first build has no heights and builds everything. The measurement
  fills the model, but only a scroll or a width change triggers another
  build. So a long windowed document built every block until the user
  first scrolled.
- **Test:** `a_windowed_ui_culls_without_being_scrolled`.

**J09 · medium · CI's `cargo test --features text-input` was red since `ec085b1`** [probe]
- The layout harness added `UiWidgetsPlugins`, whose `TextInputPlugin`
  `BevyMarkupPlugin` also adds under `text-input`. Every layout-harness
  test panicked ("plugin was already added", ~70 tests).

## Refuted

- **The count-mismatch replacement (`5f8e673`) respawns every text block
  each scroll** (text runs are child entities): entity ids are stable
  across a 1 px scroll (72 of 72 kept, and 28 of 28 for multi-run
  blocks).
- bug_0151's hypotheses: (1) a stale-band path in the wheel and restyle
  interleaving, (2) the `ScrollArea` clamp, (3) a second unit error in
  the real-window path. None was the cause. The scripted sweep
  reproduces the bug without a wheel, a pointer or a restyle. (3) is
  real (J03) but needs padding or a scale factor ≠ 1, and the owner's
  run had neither.

## Triage

1. J01 (done).
2. J02 and J03: windowing is a no-op, or worse (a rebuild every frame),
   for most real pages. Fix both before relying on the feature.
3. J04 and J05: scrolling cost.
4. J06's method for every windowing test; J07's records.

## Fixes (2026-10-16, same model)

| Finding | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| J01 | bug_0151 | spacers keep their column's gap; the root cursor reads the root frame's gap |
| J02 | bug_0152 | the measurement walks to the nearest `HtmlUi` and skips unwindowed UIs; the container cursor's double `margin-top` removed |
| J03 | bug_0153 | logical pixels of the root's content box throughout (`logical_content_width`, `visible_region`); only the measured size converted |
| J08 | bug_0154 | `WindowModel::changed` (a new or moved height) triggers one rebuild |
| J09 | bug_0155 | the harness adds only `ScrollAreaPlugin` |
| J04 | bug_0156 | scroll builds pair with the skeleton; a cached subtree reuses only without spacers and wholly inside the band; an unchanged document keeps the model's keys; scroll builds keep the strike state |
| J05 | bug_0157 | the cull decisions record the offset slack; the UI rebuilds when the offset leaves it, or the viewport's width or height changes |
| J06 | — | the original vector checks the laid-out content height and a paragraph's position; the wheel test checks the top paragraph's position; the testbench's `--windowed` adds a `band` check (the built rows cover the viewport; fails at frame 62 with bug_0151 put back) |
| J07 | — | ADR 0032 amends 0031: §3 (focus beyond the band) and §5 (headless off) dropped from the contract, the measured win re-taken with real layout (85.9 → 23.0 ms idle, 81.5 → 21.5 ms scrolling, 2000 rows, offscreen) |
| — | bug_0158 | window keys only on windowed UIs (`update_spec` keeps them in step; keyless specs don't reuse in windowed builds) |
| — | bug_0159 | the testbench's `--size` pins the size (`--exit-after`'s injected keys stepped it) |

Each fix part was falsified against its test. The J03 HiDPI test runs
the harness's camera at scale 2. `windowed_build_materializes_the_band_and_spacers_the_rest`
now expects the first build to cull (J08).

J05's `note_reused` (the slack around a subtree reused whole) has no
isolating test. The reused subtree's predecessor in the band is always
at least as tight a constraint, and without the note the cost is bounded
over-building, never a missing row.

All findings are fixed; the design changes are recorded in ADR 0032.
