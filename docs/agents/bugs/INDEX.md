# Bug Reports — Index

Upstream defects (in dependencies and tools) are also tracked in
[UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) until they're reported and fixed upstream.

Whole-crate review sessions are filed in
[reviews/](../reviews/) as numbered reports: [review_0001](../reviews/review_0001.md)
(80 findings, `R01`–`R80`), [review_0002](../reviews/review_0002.md)
(their verdicts + new defects `F01`–`F43`),
[review_0003](../reviews/review_0003.md) (the fix session's audit + new
defects `G01`–`G44`) and [review_0004](../reviews/review_0004.md) (the
G fix session's audit + new defects `H01`–`H10`). A finding gets its
own `bug_NNNN.md` here when its fix lands.

The crate was called `p23` until 2026-10-05 and is now `bevy_markup`; the
reports keep the name, paths and commands as they were at the time
(`p23::fuzz` is now `bevy_markup::fuzz`, `P23_*` variables are
`BEVY_MARKUP_*`).

Bugs found by the automated testing infrastructure. One file per bug,
`bug_NNNN.md`, numbered in discovery order. This page is the title/metadata
record; each discovery session has its own metadata section below
(bug_0001–0005: property testing, stateful testing and fuzzing — the fuzzers
immediately paid for themselves; bug_0006–0007: the Fluent oracle; bug_0008–0013: property tests and the layout oracle; bug_0014: mutation-testing triage; bug_0015: the fuzz-corpus coverage replay; bug_0016–0017: demo crashes with nested `HtmlUi`s; bug_0020: the picking-driven signals tests; bug_0021: prototype_19 integration; bug_0022: the `menu` example's smoke run; bug_0023: user report; bug_0024: code reading; bug_0025: repeated suite runs; bug_0027: the `world` example's smoke run; bug_0028: user report; bug_0029–0030: user report; bug_0031–0080: the 2026-10-13 whole-crate code review's findings, fixed the same day).

## Discovery session metadata: bug_0001–0005

### When / where

- **Date:** 2026-10-04, 09:00–10:30 +04:00
- **Machine:** hostname `anne`; Arch Linux, kernel `7.2.7-arch1-1`
  (`#1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon, 21 Sep 2026 18:51:14 +0000`), x86_64
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 8-Core (16 threads)
- **Memory:** 60 GiB

### Repository state

- **Repo:** `p23` (Bevy 0.19 HTML/CSS/Fluent UI library), working tree at
  `/home/a/fs/Bevy/PROTOTYPE_23/p23`
- **Session start HEAD:** `969556c` — "Check test vectors against real browser"
- All bugs were found in uncommitted working-tree state built on top of that
  commit; the fixes landed in the session's commits:
  `c59357f` → `042782f` (see each bug file for its exact fix commit).

### Toolchain

- rustc stable `1.98.1 (48a229cea 2026-09-01)` (library, tests)
- rustc nightly `1.100.0-nightly (4aa1fbcf4 2026-09-08)` (fuzz drivers)
- cargo-fuzz `0.13.2` (libFuzzer + AddressSanitizer)
- honggfuzz-rs `0.5.62` (vendored native honggfuzz, patched `bfd.c`)

### Dependency versions under test

- bevy `0.19.1` (minimal features: `ui_api`, `default_font`, `bevy_log`)
- bevy_fluent `0.15`, fluent `0.16.1`, fluent-syntax `0.11.1`
- lightningcss `1.0.0-alpha.72`, tera `2.4.0`, tl `0.7.8`

### Discovery agent

- Model: **`zai/glm-5.3-flash:high`** (LLM coding assistant), driving the
  fuzzers/tests interactively; every reported crash was reproduced
  deterministically and minimized before a fix was written.

### Common contract for the discovery harnesses

All fuzz targets drive the feature-gated `p23::fuzz` harness
(`#[doc(hidden)]`, `--features fuzzing`): arbitrary `&str` inputs may return
`Err` or produce any output, but must never panic, hang, or abort. The
state-machine tests (`tests/stateful.rs`) require each applied operation to
settle (rebuild observed) and the resulting dump to match a reference model.

## Discovery session metadata: bug_0006–0007

- **Date:** 2026-10-04, ~12:00 +04:00; same machine (`anne`) and Rust
  toolchain/dependency versions as above.
- **Session start HEAD:** `1169ca4` — "Add scripts for running fuzzers";
  found and fixed in the working tree on top of it, committed as `94a4fb9`.
- **Harness:** the Fluent oracle — `scripts/fluent_oracle.sh` runs
  `@fluent/dom` 0.10.2 + `@fluent/bundle` 0.19.1 in jsdom 30.1.1 (Node
  v26.10.0) over `tests/vectors/fluent_*`, writing `fluent.html`; the
  `fluent_oracle` test requires p23's localized build to equal p23's build of
  that reference DOM.
- **Discovery agent:** model **`anthropic/claude-opus-5-5:high`**. Of the
  first run's eight differences, two were these bugs; the other six were
  triaged with the user as deliberate (no sanitizing, escaped string args,
  fluent-rs number formatting) and are pinned by hand-written vectors.

## Discovery session metadata: bug_0008–0013

- **Date:** 2026-10-04, ~12:00–13:00 +04:00; same machine and toolchain.
- **Session start HEAD:** `e1b910c` — "Add browser based layout oracle".
- **Harnesses:** proptest-stateful ops for `HtmlStylesheet`/`FontFamilies`, a structure-aware arbtest document model (PropertyTests subagent), and the layout oracle extended to flex/sizes/margins.
- **Discovery agent:** `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5:high` with subagents.

## Discovery session metadata: bug_0020

- **Date:** 2026-10-05; same machine (`anne`) and toolchain.
- **Session start state:** working tree mid-development (uncommitted
  signals/focus work on top of the signals bindings).
- **Harness:** the new picking-driven test harness — `TestUi::with_pointer`
  (`tests/common/mod.rs`) spawns a primary window and aims the layout camera
  at it, then the tests write real `WindowEvent`s (`CursorMoved`,
  `MouseButtonInput`) so Bevy's full picking stack runs end to end
  (`PointerInputPlugin` → UI picking backend → pointer events → bevy_markup's
  observers and hover tracking). The `pointer-events: none` test failed on
  its first run; component dumps (`Pickable` was correctly on the block and
  its text node) pinned the miss to the span entities.
- **Discovery agent:** model `zai/glm-5.3-flash:high`.

## Discovery session metadata: bug_0016

- **Date:** 2026-10-05, ~01:50 +04:00; same machine (`anne`) and toolchain.
- **Session start HEAD:** `955e6ea` — "Use system fonts for examples, add
  ./examples/assets", plus the uncommitted HTML-only demo rewrite (a
  full-screen shell `HtmlUi` with content documents nested into its slots).
- **Harness:** the user ran `cargo run --example demo` and clicked a language
  button; the agent minimized it to a headless vector
  (`nested_ui_under_a_rebuilding_ancestor_is_skipped_not_panics`) that
  panicked identically.
- **Discovery agent:** model `zai/glm-5.3-flash:high`.

## Discovery session metadata: bug_0017

- **Date:** 2026-10-05, morning +04:00; same machine (`anne`) and toolchain.
- **Session start HEAD:** `8952749` — "Add ElementSignal bindings in HTML",
  plus the uncommitted `:hover`/`:active` work; fixed with it in `d079b08`.
- **Harness:** the demo crashed at startup (no input); traced with
  `--features bevy/debug` and `bevy_markup=debug` rebuild-decision logs, then
  pinned by the vector `restyle_with_nested_uis_keeps_them`).
- **Discovery agent:** model `zai/glm-5.3-flash:high`.

## Discovery session metadata: code review 2026-10-13 (reviews/review_0001.md)

- **Date:** 2026-10-13; same machine (`anne`, kernel `7.2.8-arch1-2`).
- **Repository state:** `bevy_markup` at `b224619` ("Bounded headless
  example runs; …"), clean tree on `main`.
- **Method:** six parallel review slices (build/skeleton reuse,
  cascade/fonts, interaction, templates/Markdown/Fluent/loaders,
  core wiring/rebuild, examples/scripts/CI) reading against AGENTS.md and
  the ADRs, each free to run throwaway probes in scratch copies; the
  integrator re-read the highest-impact claims directly. Evidence levels
  per finding: [probe] reproduced, [code] verified by reading,
  [traced] path traced without execution.
- **Fix status:** a fix session later that day (six per-slice branches,
  `fix/reuse`, `fix/build`, `fix/cascade`, `fix/content`,
  `fix/interaction`, `fix/examples`) landed the fixes: merged to `main`
  the same day (merge base `aed8fbf`, HEAD `97e16bc`). Findings with their
  own report: R02–R12, R13–R14, R17, R19–R28, R30–R47, R49–R60 →
  bug_0031–bug_0080 (sequential in review order). Not filed here: R01/R18
  (test-infrastructure fixes), R10 (doc retraction, folded into
  bug_0038/ADR 0022), R15/R16/R29 (internal perf, no observable defect),
  R48 (fuzz-harness coverage), R58 (folded into bug_0073),
  R61–R75 (example/CI-only, fixed in the same pass),
  R76–R80 (stale docs, fixed by the doc edits).
- **Discovery agent:** model `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5:high` with six
  `reviewer` subagents.
- **Fix sessions for the 2026-10-13 reviews** (opus reviewer; two fix
  sessions, then review_0003's audit + a third fix wave — see
  review_0003's Coverage/Status sections; its records corrections are
  G23–G25):
  - New defect reports: bug_0081 (F27), bug_0082 (F28), bug_0083 (F29),
    bug_0084 (F31), bug_0085 (F39), bug_0086 (F40), bug_0087 (F32,
    open — a documented deviation whose "no API" premise is FALSE, see
    the file). review_0003's G-series fixes are filed as bug_0088–
    bug_0104 (G01–G04, G08, G13–G15, G21, G26–G30, then G05+G06, G07,
    G09 as bug_0102–bug_0104). bug_0088–bug_0095 were listed here but
    never committed; review_0004's fix session wrote them (H06).
  - **The F→fix mapping** (authoritative; review_0002's Status claimed a
    mapping existed here — it didn't):
    - Re-findings of an R finding or its test: F04→R01 (bug_0031/0036),
      F05→R12 (bug_0040), F07→R55 (bug_0077), F08→R34 (bug_0058),
      F09→R49 (bug_0071), F12→R44 (bug_0067), F13→R44 (bug_0067),
      F14→R39 (bug_0063), F15→R27 (bug_0052), F16→R56 (bug_0078),
      F17→R63 (review_0002), F19→ADR 0022/0023, F20→R27 (bug_0052),
      F25→R27 (bug_0052), F28→R08 (bug_0037), F38→R27 (bug_0052),
      F39→R36 (bug_0060), F40→R35 (bug_0059), F42→R67 (bug_0069 n/a,
      test-only), F43→R69 (review_0002).
    - Internal-only (no bug file): F01/F02 (CI blockers), F03/F06 (part
      of the depth-cap work), F10/F11/F13/F22/F23/F26/F27/F29/F30/F31/
      F33/F34/F35/F36/F37/F38/F39 (fixed in the F-wave commits, each
      named in its subject), F04/F21/F41/F42 (test/CI work), F18/F19
      (bug_0079 class / ADR 0023), F24 (build.rs), G-series →
      review_0003.

## Discovery session metadata: review_0004 and its fix session (2026-10-15)

- **Review:** [review_0004](../reviews/review_0004.md) audited the G-fix
  session (`4717e13..4776aea`) at `4776aea`: CI's exact commands in a
  worktree, behaviour probes and guard reverts in a scratch worktree.
- **Reports:** bug_0105 (H01, filed by the user's session that fixed it,
  `glm-5.3-flash`), bug_0106–bug_0111 (H02–H05, H07, H08),
  bug_0112–bug_0125 (G-series and F25/R64 findings review_0003 left
  open), bug_0126 (H11, decided by the user: dedent, ADR 0024), bug_0127 (the
  same for HTML containers, ADR 0025); bug_0088–bug_0095 written retroactively (H06).
- **Discovery and fix agent:** Claude Code session, `claude-opus-5-5`
  (same model for review and fixes). Each fix's regression test was
  checked by reverting exactly that fix and watching the test fail,
  except where a report says otherwise (bug_0095, bug_0109, bug_0121,
  bug_0123, bug_0124).
- **Machine/toolchain:** as for review_0003 (Arch Linux, rustc 1.98.1,
  Bevy 0.20.0).
